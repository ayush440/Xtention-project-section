            5. Performance Results
          </h3>
          <p class="font-ProximaNova text-[20px]">
            Past performance results are shown for illustration and example
            only, are hypothetical and as such have many inherent limitations.
            No representation is being made that any account will or is likely
            to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there
            are frequently significant differences between hypothetical
            performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by
            any particular trading technique or methodology. One of the
            limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are
            prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical
            trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading
            record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in
            actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or
            adhere to a particular trading program despite trading losses are
            material factors which can adversely affect actual trading results.
            There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general
            or to the implementation of any specific trading program which
            cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical
            performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual
            trading results.
